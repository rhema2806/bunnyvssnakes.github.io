1.The bunny runs continuously from right to left. <br>

2.A snake will chase the bunny from the right side of the screen. <br>

3.Your goal is to click the snake to kill it before it reaches the bunny. <br>

4.Be careful! Only one snake appears at a time, but if the bunny crosses the left edge, a new snake will spawn from the right — it could still reach the bunny if not killed. <br>

5.Do not click the bunny by mistake, or it will die.</div>
